### Basic implementation of std::vector by Ketrix
---
# Description
`The goal of the implementation is to improve the understanding of how the std::vector class works.`  
`Some of the methods, such as "push_back", provide a strong exception safety guarantee, some provide only a basic guarantee, such as "erase", like the standard implementation.`
